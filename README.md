🤖 Knowledge Gate - Chatbot UI

Welcome to the Knowledge Gate! This project is a sleek, modern, and interactive user interface for a robot learning portal. The goal of this UI is to provide a gateway where a robot can eventually ask for book recommendations about Earth.

    Staggered Animations: Components slide and fade into view at different intervals for a premium feel.

    Fully Responsive: Designed to look great on both desktop and mobile screens.

    Flexbox Powered: A clean and robust layout built using modern CSS Flexbox.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
